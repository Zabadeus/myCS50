                <h2>What is  O ?</h2>
                <br>
                O is a non-profit orientated platform to buy, sell, meet and share for aware people to make a difference.<br> 
                <br>
                O has many facets - hance the non-descriptive name
                <br>
                At its root O is a collaboratively driven online marketplace designed to benefit buyers and sellers alike - your actions benefit you and the entire community and beyond. <br>
                <br>
                Everybody is a consumer - already by simply breathing oxygen. That’s just the way it is. It’s a necessity. But until O, it was difficult to exercise that choice with consciousness of the true cost of what we consume. The price paid is not really equal to the direct and indirect costs of production. Think about it.
                Flights that take you across Europe for less than 300, 100, 30, 10 Euro?!
                Banana that are cheaper than the regional apples?!<br>
                <br>
                At O we strive to make the impact of consumption positive to the wellbeing of all.<br>

            <div id = "Methods" class = "section">
                We achieve this through transparency and a concept of balance.<br>

                        <li>
                            As an average consumer it is hard to know which product has what impact on the world.
                            That’s why we have experts who rate the products sold on our platform for easy comparison and guidelines to discern for oneself and contribute to the ratings.<br>
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Every consumer can be a vendor. A fair commission plan enables growth of small businesses (find out more about becoming a vendor and its conditions <a href="o-account.html">here</a>)<br>

                            All vendors on the platform share comprehensive details about their products, the origin of materials used, work and production means, labour conditions, goals and aspirations.
                            Openness is a must.<br>

                We have developed O-Karma with the objective of fostering balance

                    making sustainable consumption accessible for all<br>

                <br>
                O-Karma is a system that rewards your actions with a fair reaction.
                O takes a commission from the vendors as mentioned <a href="o-account.html"> above</a> and aside from using it to cover its maintenance costs, all excess will be given back as a Bonus - the Karma-Bonus.<br>

                Customers link themselves with other customers by sending their customer-ID to their chosen recipient, creating a root. This root is usually the person who has told the new customer about the O-platform.<br>
                By linking customers together and sharing this platform with friends, one creates an O-Friend-Tree.
                To gratify this word-of-mouth marketing we give a Friend-Bonus.<br>
                <br>
                By recommending products directly to specific friends one gets an extra bonus.
                This Recommendation-Bonus can be set by every vendor for every product individually.<br>
                <br>
                But not just buying and selling things are important on O. Participating on the marketplace by creating valuable contributions for vendors and other customers such as reviews, ratings, comments, blog-posts etc. are rewarded with an Activity-Bonus.<br>
                <br>
                And further, life is not just about solo web surfing but a social playground for exchange. Therefore we at O want to support real-life gatherings of users by awardings events with a Social-Bonus.<br>
                <br>
